The purpose of this website is to conduct data analysis on datasets containing metadata information on a text corpus of scholarly articles, as an end-of-course project for the "Digital Text in Humanities" course of the Master Degree in Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge of the University of Bologna, held by professor Tiziana Mancinelli.

The datasets have been selected for their size and complexity from JSTOR digital library and are used exclusively for educational purpose.
